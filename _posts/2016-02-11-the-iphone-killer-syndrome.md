So here's the thing, Tag Heuer unveiled yesterday their smartwatch with Google and Intel. I'm not going to talk about specific technical details, you just need to know that it's got a titanium structure, a rubber band, an Intel processor and the Android OS which I'm not going to bash here, they do it perfectly fine by themselves. I'm more having a look at the strategy behind it.

A few months ago I've written a piece called -[Time to say "I told you so..."][0]- and it really described how the Swiss watch making industry has become**lazy and megalomaniac**enough to spit on the Apple Watch. As written before, I used to own many watches, from a 60$ Casio to a many$ Patek Philippe. This summer, I got the Apple Watch stainless steel and I can say now that there's no way I'm going back.**It's like using an iPhone and all of the sudden going back to a Nokia 3210... just won't happen**.

So, before having a laugh, I would like to send my respect to Jean-Claude Biver (CEO of Tag Heuer) for being the first real Swiss watch maker to compete with the Apple Watch. Unlike the cheap Samsung Gear, Tag Heuer could play the luxury card and that brand was perfect to launch a smartwatch because in the luxury watch brands world, it's also a performance watch (racing, tennis...). 

Now, let's compare what's comparable. The**Tag Heuer Connected Watch**is priced at $1'500 (left) so I've looked for the counter part at Apple and it happened to be the**Apple Watch HERMES Edition**at $1'100 (right).

One cannot compare the look because it's too subjective and to be honest, the Tag Heuer is pretty nice looking but that's besides the point. Their challenge was to make it look like a mechanical watch and that's where I'm coming at:**there are books and then there are e-books**. Making something hybrid makes no sense because as I've learned in my Harvard Branding class, you have to be true to yourself as a brand otherwise you are taking the risk to confuse your crowd.

During the Tag Heuer keynote, Jean-Claude Biver said that after the 2 years warranty of the watch, should you want to, you could go to a shop, have it transformed into a mechanical for an extra 1'500$ so at the end, your Tag Heuer would have costed 3'000$ (which to be faire, is an average price for a real Swiss mechanical watch). That's a fake good idea because:

1\. Tag Heuer does not gain value with time like a certain Patek Philippe and...  
2\. Once you wear a smartwatch, why would you ever want to go back to a mechanical one again?

Let's be clear, I'm not talking about those who absolutely love and respect the mechanical watch system. There are collectors and aficionados who are truly passionate about complication movements and other Swiss technical prowess and that's fine (those people don't buy Tag Heuer anyway). I'm talking about who Tag Heuer is going after: that's right, the same target as Apple wrists. 

I understand that for Tag Heuer, making a smartwatch is all about survival. We know what happened to MP3 players who did not stand a chance against the iPod (remember Riot? Zune anyone? that's right). We're currently at the dawn of technological wearable and unless the Swiss watchmakers focus on adopting Apple Watch OS (the dominating player), I'm pretty sure that many of them will be gone. How many "iPhone killers" has Samsung launched since 2007? None. Watchmakers shouldn't compete against Apple unless they have a really strong brand and some sort of innovative interface Apple doesn't have.

Oh and I'm not talking about other Swiss smartwatches just because Tag Heuer had a keynote yesterday. I did not mention SWATCH "smartwatch" because it's simply pathetic... you know... that company from that cigar-smoking-clown Hayek who accomplished nothing and inherited from his dad? Yup, we all remember how SWATCH turned down the iPod before it was Apple's. Morons.
